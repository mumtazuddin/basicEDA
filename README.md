# Basic-EDA

This is one of the first codes i ever did in python which has some basic EDA and data cleaning and visualization included in it. It was my first time hands-on learning experience with python.

Text of proposal

I was going through the internet for datasets for the project proposal and i wanted a sample data set of name city address zip number so i landed on this page

URL- https://www.briandunning.com/sample-data/us-500.zip

I was browsing through kaggle, datagov and one click to another i ended up on this data set which matches my view and follows the rubric- So i edited a bit of this data set because i wanted to work on a unique set of data, so i deleted 300 rows and 3 columns making it to 200 rows and 8 columns.

and i am attaching the new text file which i edited to work on this, and the url is the original file. This data has 200 rows, 8 columns and at least 2 different types of entries. The file size is 20kb

I understand this data because i am a beginner in python and this is a data set for a beginner to work on it contains different rows and column and it is pretty straight forward.

Data was free to download.
